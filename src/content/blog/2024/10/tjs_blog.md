![A screenshot of the "tobus app". On the top half of the screen it has a large action button written "next vehicle" and an input field that reads "bus/streetcar stop no.". On the bottom half it has an an input box to search for a line number, a list of favourites, showing the line number, name, and ETA for the next vehicle; followed by a button to edit bookmarks. Lastly a menu bar on the bottom of the screen with three options: home, lines, and settings.](./assets/tom/mobile.png)
